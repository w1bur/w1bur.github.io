## Operation
We had several operators including guest operators.
Below is a clip of BU student contacting another station in Italy, II9T.
Distance from Boston to Italy is about 4000 miles!

All stations identify themselves with a unique callsign - it's like a license plate on a car. BU Amateur Radio Club has a callsign W1BUR, and the station we talked to was II9T.
For the ARRL DX Contest, stations in US sends signal report and the State as a contest number, and non-US stations send signal report and power output. So, "59 500" means: 

    I hear you loud and clear and I'm transmitting at 500 Watts

while "59 MA" means 
    
    I hear you loud and clear and I'm in Massachusetts.

On this day, W1BUR had made contacts with following countries and regions:
