Welcome to the students, staff, alumni, and friends of W1BUR amateur radio station at Boston University this Fall 2016 semester!
We have our [Echolink](http://echolink.org) service running at W1BUR-L, node 631098. 
Any licensed amateur radio operator can [signup for Echolink](http://echolink.org/validation/) and join via smartphone, computer, or radio. 
You can see [stations logged in worldwide on Echolink](http://echolink.org/logins.jsp) with whom to connect. 
Likewise we can connect the Boston University Echolink server to other systems for example our multi-university nets.

The RF connected to Echolink is shared with the BUSAT ground station, but when available it's on 446.025MHz, PL 100.0. 
Coverage is limited to the immediate Charles River Campus near the Boston University Photonics Center. 
An effort to make a permanent Echolink setup would be welcomed; there is existing 
[Raspberry Pi Echolink server software/hardware available for beta test from the OpenRepeater project](https://openrepeater.com/blog/hardware-interface-update).
