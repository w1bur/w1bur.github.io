These repeaters are not affiliated with Boston University Amateur Radio Club, but are mostly within radio communications range when above ground on campus.
These data are from https://nerepeaters.com and you should check there for up to date repeaters information.


## Boston Repeaters

These repeaters are located in the city of Boston.
I only include analog repeaters, not NXDN, D-Star, DMR, etc. because many hams just starting out may have only an analog radio.
