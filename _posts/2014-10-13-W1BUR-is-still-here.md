We lost access to our main ham shack room due to exciting research that needed the space. 
We haven't forgotten about ham radio and are looking for interested students/staff/community members. 
In particular, how might we exploit our high location for experimental technology such as Bluetooth Low Energy to beacon our existence to the BU community? 
An APRS node would be useful?
