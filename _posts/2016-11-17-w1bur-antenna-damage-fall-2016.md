Damaging weather over the past year was discovered to have taken a toll at W1BUR.
All the antennas are broken.

* VHF/UHF: cannot even reach NEU 2 meter repeater, almost like the coax is cut off
* end-fed dipole: can't hear almost anything, also question if coax was cut off
* broadband dipole: half of it fell down, other half looks OK

Additionally, both rotating coax jumper cables for the BUSAT Ground station VHF/UHF yagis are destroyed from overrotation.
