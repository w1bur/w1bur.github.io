The W1BUR Icom IC-756 has had the power connection to the 14 V 25 Amp station power supply upgraded to Anderson Powerpole. 
Crimp ring terminals can rotate on the power supply and short out, damaging the power supply and radio.
Anderson Powerpole power connectors were installed for the Icom IC-756 and Yaesu mobile rated for 45 Amps and that are mechanically robusts.
