title: W1BUR plans for Fall 2016
---

We are brainstorming on the [W1BUR wiki](https://github.com/w1bur/w1bur-wiki/wiki) about ideas to regularize the ebb and flow common to university and school based amateur radio clubs.
A key element of school ham radio club stability is encompassing students from all majors/concentrations. 
We are developing workable plans using equipment in our possession to accomplish these goals.

One first step is we've heard that NEU Wireless Club has restarted a net, it will be good to join our Echolink station with their repeater during the net. 
We have reached out to NEU Wireless Club in this regard.

We will also investigate setting up the BU HF station for remote operations, as was proposed in 2012 and I don't see any real blockers for this happening now.
The HF station will have to be setup so that it doesn't bother other tenants of the room and be durable against people throwing backpacks at the equipment. 
It might even mean building/buying a small enclosure to protect the gear.

First however we will establish the status of the HF/VHF/UHF antennas and repair if necessary.
