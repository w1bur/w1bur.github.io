We've started a [Facebook W1BUR group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/w1bur) and we would encourage you to join to stay up on events.
For example, join our W1BUR Facebook group to help plan our first semester kickoff meeting.

We have previously used a 1980's style text-only email list, but this was difficult to maintain and lacked the ability for users to share quickly. 

The https://w1bur.github.io website is more archival in nature, recording the highlights for future generations of W1BUR operators.
The dynamics of day-to-day interaction seem better served by a Facebook group, so there we have it.
