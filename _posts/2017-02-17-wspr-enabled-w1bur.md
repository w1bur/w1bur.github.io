[W1BUR is now using WSPR](http://wsprnet.org/olddb?mode=html&band=all&limit=50&findcall=&findreporter=w1bur&sort=date) in support of [PiRadar experimentation](https://www.scivision.co/pi-radar).
The W1BUR HF antenna is broken, but still hears signals throughout Western hemisphere, including Antarctica. 
When the weather warms up to the 50's or so, antenna repair work can begin.
