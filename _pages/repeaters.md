## Cost of Amateur Radio vs. GMRS license

* Amateur Radio licenses cost $15, for life (free renewal) upon passing a licensing exam. Individuals that already have an amateur radio license from another country can get a reciprocal operating permit.
* GMRS licenses cost $65 for a 10-year term, no exam (the [ten-year GMRS license term is new in the May 2017 FCC Report & Order](https://www.fcc.gov/document/part-95-report-and-order))
