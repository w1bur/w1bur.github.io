W1BUR has benefited greatly from the support of the Undergraduate Program Office and donors whose generosity we recognize.

The current W1BUR station equipment roster includes:

* Icom IC-756 (non-Pro)
* Ten Tec Omni VI  (transmit broken on 80 meters)
* Ameritron AL-811 amplifier (wired for 120 Vac)
* Intel Core 2 Duo PC with latest Ubuntu Linux
* MFJ Antenna analyzer
* SWR meters
* iambic CW key

W1BUR is in the Photonics Building, in space generously provided by the ECE Department and specifically thanks to Professor Horenstein and ECE Department Chair W. C. Karl.


## BUSAT Ground Station
The BUARC has worked hand-in-hand with the BUSAT cubesat team with regard to the wireless communications portion. 
We have assisted in communicating through several satellites. 
The terrestrial range of the system is excellent. 
We did identify some overloading issues due to strong signal overload driving intermodulation products in the tower top amplifiers.

The need for additional bandwidth for the relatively short BUSAT mission ultimately led to a commercial wireless solution being used instead of the ground station. 
Nonetheless, the BUSAT ground station serves other Cubesat missions.

Please contact us if your Cubesat or balloon team needs ground station support.

### BUSAT Antennas

* Glen Martin RT-832
* 430 MHz Circularly Polarized M<sup>2</sup> 436CP30  (switchable polarization relays not installed)
* 144 MHz Circularly Polarized M<sup>2</sup> 2MCP14 (switchable polarization relays not installed)

### BUSAT Equipment
Almost everything powered from main power supply and Anderson Powerpole distribution bus.

* Kenwood TS-2000 (no 1200 MHz option)
* 50 Amp Astron linear power supply
* Kantronics KPC-9612+
